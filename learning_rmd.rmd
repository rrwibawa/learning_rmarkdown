# Introduction

> expected outcomes:

- learn how to create Rmarkdown document
- learn various document types, e.g. html, pdf and docx
- ~~learn to fly the rocket!~~

The bottomline is, I would like to learn Rmarkdown!
<br> 
Like ***seriously*** become **good** at it!

## Task list for today

- [X] Get aspired to learn R markdown
- [ ] Get to know three core components of the Rmarkdown document (header, body, R chunks)
- [ ] Practice, practice!

## Code

You can use single backtick on each side of the code for inline or triple backticks for standalone code block

```BASH
#!/usr/bin/bash

echo "Why am I doing BASH in this course?"

Rscript --vanilla run_away.R
```

## Math
This is a covariance equation, random variable $X$ co-variance with random variable $Y$, where $\\bar{X} = mean(X)$ and $\\bar{Y} = mean(Y)$ and $N$ is a size of a random sample from the population.

$$
cov(X,Y) = \frac{\\sum(X_{i}-\\bar{X})(Y_{i}-\\bar{Y})}{N-1}
$$

## Images
The syntax to add image is "[text](link)"

The ! is added to show that the link is for image, not for text.

## Getting and wrangling the data

```{r get_data}
make_url <- function(package) {
  paste0('<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/', package, '">', package, '</a>')
}

library(magrittr)
library(dplyr)

avail_packages <- available.packages(contriburl = contrib.url("https://mirror.aarnet.edu.au/pub/CRAN/")) %>% 
                    as.data.frame() %>% 
                    as_tibble() %>% 
                    rowwise() %>% 
                    mutate(Depend = length(unlist(strsplit(Imports, split = ",")))) %>% 
                    ungroup() %>% 
                    select(Package, Version, Depend, Imports, License) %>% 
                    mutate(Package = make_url(Package),
                           Depend = ifelse(is.na(Imports), -1, Depend)) 
```

## Displaying table

```{r make_table, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(DT)
avail_packages %>% datatable(escape = FALSE)
```

## Plot the data

```{r plot}
library(ggplot2)
avail_packages %>% ggplot(aes(Depend)) + geom_bar()
```

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
